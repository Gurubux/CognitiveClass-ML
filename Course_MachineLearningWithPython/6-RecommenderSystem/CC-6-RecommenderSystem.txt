@IMPLEMENTING RECOMMENDOR SYSTEMS :
	In "memory-based" approaches, we use the entire user-item dataset to generate a recommendation system. It uses statistical techniques to approximate users or items. Examples of these techniques include: Pearson Correlation, Cosine Similarity and Euclidean Distance, among others. 
	In "model-based" approaches, a model of users is developed in an attempt to learn their preferences. Models can be created using Machine Learning techniques like regression, clustering, classification, and so on.

Advantages and Disadvantages of Content-Based Filtering
Advantages
	Learns user`s preferences
	Highly personalized for the user
Disadvantages
	Doesn`t take into account what others think of the item, so low quality item recommendations might happen
	Extracting data is not always intuitive
	Determining what characteristics of the item the user dislikes or likes is not always obvious

\Let`s also remove the year from the title column by using pandas` replace function and store in a new year column.

#Using regular expressions to find a year stored between parentheses
#We specify the parantheses so we don't conflict with movies that have years in their titles
movies_df['year'] = movies_df.title.str.extract('(\(\d\d\d\d\))',expand=False)
#Removing the parentheses
movies_df['year'] = movies_df.year.str.extract('(\d\d\d\d)',expand=False)
#Removing the years from the 'title' column
movies_df['title'] = movies_df.title.str.replace('(\(\d\d\d\d\))', '')
#Applying the strip function to get rid of any ending whitespace characters that may have appeared
movies_df['title'] = movies_df                                                         ['title'].apply(lambda x: x.strip())

\With that, let's also split the values in the Genres column into a list of Genres to simplify future use. This can be achieved by applying Python's split string function on the correct column.
#Every genre is separated by a | so we simply have to call the split function on |

\One Hot Encoding technique to convert the list of genres to a vector where each column corresponds to one possible value of the feature.
#Copying the movie dataframe into a new one since we won't need to use the genre information in our first case.
moviesWithGenres_df = movies_df.copy()

#For every row in the dataframe, iterate through the list of genres and place a 1 into the corresponding column
for index, row in movies_df.iterrows():
    for genre in row                                                         ['genres']:

#Filling in the NaN values with 0 to show that a movie doesn't have that column's genre
moviesWithGenres_df = moviesWithGenres_df.fillna(0)
moviesWithGenres_df.head()

@Content Based Filtering
This technique attempts to figure out what a user`s favourite aspects of an item is, and then recommends items that present those aspects. In our case, we`re going to try to figure out the input`s favorite genres from the movies and ratings given.

Let`s begin by creating an input user to recommend movies to:
Notice: To add more movies, simply increase the amount of elements in the userInput. Feel free to add more in! Just be sure to write it in with capital letters and if a movie starts with a "The", like "The Matrix" then write it in like this: 'Matrix, The' .

userInput =                                                          [
            {'title':'Breakfast Club, The', 'rating':5},
            {'title':'Toy Story', 'rating':3.5},
            {'title':'Jumanji', 'rating':2},
            {'title':"Pulp Fiction", 'rating':5},
            {'title':'Akira', 'rating':4.5}
         ] 
inputMovies = pd.DataFrame(userInput)
inputMovies

	rating	title
0	5.0		Breakfast Club, The
1	3.5		Toy Story
2	2.0		Jumanji
3	5.0		Pulp Fiction
4	4.5		Akira



\Add movieId to input user
#Filtering out the movies by title
inputId = movies_df[movies_df['title'].isin(inputMovies['title'].tolist())]
#Then merging it so we can get the movieId. It's implicitly merging it by title.
inputMovies = pd.merge(inputId, inputMovies)
#Dropping information we won't use from the input dataframe
inputMovies = inputMovies.drop('genres', 1).drop('year', 1)
#Final input dataframe
#If a movie you added in above isn't here, then it might not be in the original 
#dataframe or it might spelled differently, please check capitalisation.

"Advantages"
	Takes other user`s ratings into consideration
	Doesn`t need to study Or extract information From the recommended item
	Adapts to the user`s interests which might change over time
"Disadvantages"
	Approximation function can be slow
	There might be a low of amount of users to approximate
	Privacy issues when trying to learn the user`s preferences
