	It represents how close the data values are to the fitted regression line.			
	R-squared values, like 0.73, can be translated into percentages by simply multiplying them by 100. An R-squared value of 0.73 means that there is a 73% reduction in variation around a fitted line compared to the mean. If R-squared was 1, then there would be a 100% reduction and if R-squared = 0, there would be a 0% reduction.

P𝒻ᵢₜ 	-> Parameters in the regression Line
Pₘₑₐₙ 	-> All the parameters become 0 except intercept thus Pₘₑₐₙ is usually 1
n 		-> Number of data points
