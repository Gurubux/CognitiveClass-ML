WHAT ARE ZEPPELIN NOTEBOOKS?
The Zeppelin interpreter concept allows any language or data-processing-backend to be plugged into Zeppelin.
Currently Apache Zeppelin supports many interpreters such as Apache Spark, Python, JDBC, Markdown and Shell.
Apache Zeppelin, in particular, provides built-in "Apache Spark"integration.

Apache Zeppelin with Spark integration provides a number of great features, including : 
Automatic SparkContext and SQLContext injection Runtime jar dependency loading from local filesystem or maven repository, as well as Canceling job and progress display

For data visualization, here are some basic charts already included in Apache Zeppelin.
Visualizations are not limited to SparkSQL query in fact, any output from any language backend can be recognized and visualized.
For Pivot charts, Apache Zeppelin aggregates values and displays them in a pivot chart with simple drag and drop.
You can easily create charts with multiple aggregated values including sum, count, average, minimum, and maximum.

1. Apache Zeppelin lets you:
 Switch between multiple languages.  Display your output.  Show your visualizations within the Zeppelin notebook.  Document your code.

2. MATLAB is NOT an interpreter in supported by Zeppelin?

3. Major benefits to using Zeppelin over Jupyter notebooks include:
 - Some visualizations are automatically generated in Zeppelin, thus minimizing code required  
 - You can use multiple languages in the same notebook in Zeppelin, but not in Jupyter
