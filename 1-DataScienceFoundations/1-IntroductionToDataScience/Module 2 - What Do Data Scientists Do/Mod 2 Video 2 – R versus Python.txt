As I have an engineering background,
I started programming with C, then I went to Matlab,
and eventually to Python.
I usually use Matlab, C, and C++,
but for data science I use Python.
- R and Python.
- R.
- I'm an R evangelist.
I was at the useR Conference last year
and I think it's got one of the best communities,
I'm also very fond of SQL and I think people don't spend
enough time appreciating it in its various incarnations.
- I primarily work with R and Stata.
I do not work a lot with big data so for the kind
of data sets I have, there are a few million observations,
even the hundreds of millions of observations
then I can work with with the existing Stata and R and SPSS,
I don't have a problem with it,
but as I said, if I were to work with large data sets,
I would use different tools.
My preferred tools are the three; R, Stata, and SPSS.
I also work with spacial data a lot
so these are data sets which have a geographical
component to it, so imagine 40 million Californians
and 40 million people, some of them in California,
some of them in the neighboring states,
and what if I know the exact home address
of each and everyone of them and where they work.
And that would be an amazing GIS,
spacial geographic information systems database.
So I work with those as well and my tool that I use
is called Maptitude and MapInfo,
these are the two I use the most.
