Module 4: From Modeling to Evaluation

MODELING
Data Modelling focuses on developing models that are either descriptive or predictive.
An example of a "descriptive model" might examine things like: if a person did this, then they`re likely to prefer that.
A "predictive model" tries to yield yes/no, or stop/go type outcomes. These models are based on the analytic approach that was taken, either statistically driven or machine learning driven.

The success of data compilation, preparation and modelling, depends on the understanding of the problem at hand, and the appropriate analytical approach being taken.
The data supports the answering of the question, and like the quality of the ingredients in cooking, sets the stage for the outcome. Constant refinement, adjustments and tweaking are necessary within each step to ensure the outcome is one that is solid.

In John Rollins` descriptive Data Science Methodology, the framework is geared to do 3 things: 
	First, understand the question at hand. 
	Second, select an analytic approach or method to solve the problem, and
	third, obtain, understand, prepare, and model the data.

The end goal is to move the data scientist to a point where a data model can be built to answer the question.

In this stage of the methodology, model evaluation, deployment, and feedback loops ensure that the answer is near and relevant.

EVALUATION
Model evaluation can have two main phases.
	The first is the diagnostic measures phase, which is used to ensure the model is working as intended.
		If the model is a predictive model, a decision tree can be used to evaluate if the answer the model can output, is aligned to the initial design. It can be used to see where there are areas that require adjustments.
		If the model is a descriptive model, one in which relationships are being assessed, then a testing set with known outcomes can be applied, and the model can be refined as needed.
	The second phase of evaluation that may be used is statistical significance testing.
		This type of evaluation can be applied to the model to ensure that the data is being properly handled and interpreted within the model.
	This is designed to avoid unnecessary second guessing when the answer is revealed.
