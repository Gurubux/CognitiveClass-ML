<p><h3>Supervised learning</h3>
Supervise means to observe and direct the execution of a task, project, or activity.<br>
We&rsquo;ll be supervising a machine learning model that might be able to produce classification regions like we see here.<br>
We do this by &ldquo;teaching&rdquo; the model.That is, we load the model with knowledge so that we can have it predict future instances.<br>
&ldquo;How exactly do we teach a model?&rdquo;<br>
We teach the model by training it with some data from a labeled dataset.<br>
Example : The cancer dataset. As you can see, we have some historical data for patients, and <strong>we already know the class of each row.</strong></p>

<p>When dealing with machine learning, the most commonly used data is numeric. The second is categorical&#8230; that is, it&rsquo;s non-numeric, because it contains characters rather than numbers.<br>
In cancer dataset case, it&rsquo;s categorical because this dataset is made for Classification.</p>

<p><strong>Types of Supervised Learning techniques, classification and regression.</strong><br>
<strong>Classification</strong> is the process of predicting a discrete class label or category.</strong><br>
<strong>Regression</strong> is the process of predicting a continuous value as opposed to predicting a categorical value in Classification.<br>
Example : Co2 emissions of different cars dataset.<br>
It includes Engine size, Cylinders, Fuel Consumption and Co2 emission of various models of automobiles.<br>
Given this dataset, you can use regression to predict the Co2 emission of a new car by<br>
using other fields, such as Engine size or number of Cylinders.</p>

<p><h3>Unsupervised Learning</h3>
We do not supervise the model, but we let the model work on its own to discover information that may not be visible to the human eye.<br>
It means, The Unsupervised algorithm trains on the dataset, and draws conclusions on <strong>UNLABELED data.</strong> <br>
Generally speaking, unsupervised learning has more difficult algorithms than supervised learning, since we know little to no information about the data, or the outcomes that are to be expected.<br>
<strong>Unsupervised machine learning techniques</strong> : Dimension reduction, Density estimation, Market basket analysis and Clustering<br>
1. DIMENSIONALITY REDUCTION and/or FEATURE SELECTION play a large role in this by reducing redundant features to make the classification easier.<br>
2. MARKET BASKET ANALYSIS is a modelling technique based upon the theory that if you buy a certain group of items, you&rsquo;re more likely to buy another group of items.<br>
3. DENSITY ESTIMATION is a very simple concept that is mostly used to explore the data to<br>
find some structure within it.<br>
4. CLUSTERING is considered to be one of the most popular unsupervised machine learning techniques used for grouping data points or objects that are somehow similar.</p>

<p><strong>Applications in different domains</strong><br>
 - a bank&rsquo;s desire to segment its customers based on certain characteristics,<br>
 - Helping an individual to organize and group his/her favourite types of music!<br>
Clustering is used mostly for: Discovering structure, Summarization, and Anomaly detection.</p>

<p><h3>Difference between Supervised and Unsupervised Learning</h3><br>
1. Supervised learning deals with labeled data while Unsupervised Learning deals with unlabeled<br>
data.<br>
2. In supervised learning, we have machine learning algorithms for Classification and Regression.<br>
In unsupervised learning, we have methods such as clustering.<br>
3. In comparison to supervised learning, unsupervised learning has fewer models and fewer evaluation<br>
methods that can be used to ensure that the outcome of the model is accurate.<br>
As such, unsupervised learning creates a less controllable environment, as the machine is<br>
creating outcomes for us.<br>
