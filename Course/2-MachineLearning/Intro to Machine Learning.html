<p>A human cell sample extracted from a patient. And this cell has characteristics &#8230; for example, its Clump thickness is 6, its Uniformity of cell size is 1, its Marginal adhesion is 1, and so on. One of the interesting questions we can ask, at this point is: &quot;Is this a Benign or Malignant cell?&quot;<br>
In contrast with a benign tumor, a malignant tumor is a tumor that may invade its surrounding tissue or spread around the body, and diagnosing it early might be the key to a patient&rsquo;s survival. <br>
Analysis of the original data showed that many of the characteristics differed significantly between benign and malignant samples. You can use the values of these cell characteristics in samples from other patients to give an early indication of whether a new sample might be benign or malignant.</p>

<p><strong>Machine learning!</strong><br>
- You should clean your data, (Clean)<br>
- Select a proper algorithm for building a prediction model,(Build Model)<br>
- Train your model to understand patterns of benign or malignant cells within the data.(Train model)<br>
- Once the model has been trained by going through data iteratively, it can be used to predict your new or unknown cell with a rather high accuracy.(Predict)</p>

<strong>Definition of machine learning.</strong><br>
Machine learning is the subfield of computer science that gives &quot;computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>&ldquo;without being explicitly programmed.&rdquo;</strong><br>
Machine learning algorithms, inspired by the human learning process, iteratively learn from data, and allow computers to find hidden insights.<br>
These models help us in a variety of tasks, such as object recognition, summarization, recommendation, and so on.</p>

<p><strong>Examples</strong><br>
1. Netflix and Amazon recommend videos, movies, and TV shows to its users? They use Machine Learning to produce suggestions that you might enjoy! This is similar to how your friends might recommend a television show to you, based on their knowledge of the types of shows you like to watch.</p>

<p>2. How do you think banks make a decision when approving a loan application?<br>
They use machine learning to predict the probability of default for each applicant, and then approve or refuse the loan application based on that probability.</p>

<p>3. Telecommunication companies use their customers&rsquo; demographic data to segment them, or predict if they will unsubscribe from their company the next month.</p>

<p>4. There are many other applications of machine learning that we see every day in our daily life, such as chatbots, logging into our phones or even computer games using face recognition.</p>

<p><strong>Different machine learning techniques and algorithms.</strong><br>
1. REGRESSION/ESTIMATION technique is used for predicting a continuous value, for example, <br>
&nbsp; predicting things like the price of a house based on its characteristics, or <br>
&nbsp; to estimate the Co2 emission from a car&rsquo;s engine.<br>
2. A CLASSIFICATION technique is used for Predicting the class or category of a case, for example,<br>
&nbsp; if a cell is benign or malignant, or <br>
&nbsp; whether or not a customer will churn.<br>
3. CLUSTERING groups of similar cases, for example, <br>
&nbsp; can find similar patients, or <br>
&nbsp; can be used for customer segmentation in the banking field.<br>
4. ASSOCIATION TECHNIQUE is used for finding items or events that often co-occur, for example,<br>
&nbsp; grocery items that are usually bought together by a particular customer.(Market basket analysis)<br>
5. ANOMALY DETECTION is used to discover abnormal and unusual cases, for example, <br>
&nbsp; it is used for credit card fraud detection.<br>
6. SEQUENCE MINING is used for predicting the next event, for instance, <br>
&nbsp; the click-stream in websites.<br>
7. DIMENSION REDUCTION is used to reduce the size of data.<br>
8. RECOMMENDATION SYSTEMS; this associates people's preferences with others who have similar tastes, and recommends new items to them, such &nbsp;as books or movies.</p>

<p><strong>Difference between Artificial intelligence(or AI), Machine Learning and Deep Learning?</strong><br>
- AI tries to make computers intelligent in order to mimic the cognitive functions<br>
of humans.Artificial Intelligence is a general field with a broad scope including: Computer Vision,<br>
Language Processing, Creativity, and Summarization.<br>
- Machine Learning is the branch of AI that covers the statistical part of artificial<br>
intelligence. It teaches the computer to solve problems by looking at hundreds or thousands of examples,<br>
learning from them, and then using that experience to solve the same problem in new situations.<br>
- Deep Learning is a very special field of Machine Learning where computers can actually<br>
learn and make intelligent decisions on their own. Deep learning involves a deeper level of automation in comparison with most machine learning algorithms.<br>
