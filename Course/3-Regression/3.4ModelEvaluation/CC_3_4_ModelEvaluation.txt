REGRESSION MODEL EVALUATION 
Two types of evaluation approaches that can be used to achieve this goal.These approaches are: 
	1. train and test on the same dataset, and 
	2. train/test split.

	MAE   =  1/n   Σ | yᵢ - ŷ |

	MSE   =  1/n   Σ (yᵢ - ŷ )²

	R² Score  = 1 - RSS/TSS
				where,
					RSS =  Residual sum of squares (Difference from the Predictions)
					TSS =  Total sum of squares (Difference from the mean)
