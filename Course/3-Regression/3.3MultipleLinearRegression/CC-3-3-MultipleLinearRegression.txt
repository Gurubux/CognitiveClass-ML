Basically, adding too many independent variables without any theoretical justification may result in an over-fit model.

	ŷ = b0 + b1x1 + b2x2 + … + bk-1xk-1 + bkxk
	Y = Xb
	X`Y = X`Xb 
		Here, matrix X` is the transpose of matrix X. To solve for regression coefficients, simply pre-multiply by the inverse of X`X:
	(X`X)-1X`Xb = (X`X)-1X`Y
	b 			= (X`X)-1X`Y
