Let me answer two important questions here: 

First, “How can I know if a problem is linear or non-linear in an easy way?”
To answer this question, we have to do two things:
	The first is to visually figure out if the relation is linear or non-linear. It’s best to plot bivariate plots of output variables with each input variable.
	Also, you can calculate the correlation coefficient between independent and dependent variables, and if for all variables it is 0.7 or higher there is a linear tendency, and, thus, it’s not appropriate to fit a non-linear regression.

	The second thing we have to do is to use non-linear regression instead of linear regression when we cannot accurately model the relationship with linear parameters.

The second important questions is, “How should I model my data, if it displays non-linear on a scatter plot?”
	Well, to address this, you have to use either a polynomial regression, use a non-linear regression model, or "transform" your data, which is not in scope for this course.
